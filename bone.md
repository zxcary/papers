**summary:** \
Inactivation of β-catenin in mesenchymal progenitors prevents osteoblast differentiation; inactivation of Lrp5, a gene encoding a likely Wnt coreceptor, results in low bone mass (osteopenia) by decreasing bone formation. These observations indicate that Wnt signaling controls osteoblast differentiation and suggest that it may regulate bone formation in differentiated osteoblasts. Here, we study later events and find that stabilization of β-catenin in differentiated osteoblasts results in high bone mass, while its deletion from differentiated osteoblasts leads to osteopenia. Surprisingly, histological analysis showed that these mutations primarily affect bone resorption rather than bone formation. Cellular and molecular studies showed that β-catenin together with TCF proteins regulates osteoblast expression of Osteoprotegerin, a major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that β-catenin, and presumably Wnt signaling, promote the ability of differentiated osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation; thus, they broaden our knowledge of the functions Wnt proteins have at various stages of skeletogenesis.

**summary:** \
Chondrocytes and osteoblasts are two primary cell types in the skeletal system that are differentiated from common mesenchymal progenitors. It is believed that osteoblast differentiation is controlled by distinct mechanisms in intramembranous and endochondral ossification. We have found that ectopic canonical Wnt signaling leads to enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation. Conversely, genetic inactivation of β-catenin, an essential component transducing the canonical Wnt signaling, causes ectopic formation of chondrocytes at the expense of osteoblast differentiation during both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Moreover, inactivation of β-catenin in mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro causes chondrocyte differentiation under conditions allowing only osteoblasts to form. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin is essential in determining whether mesenchymal progenitors will become osteoblasts or chondrocytes regardless of regional locations or ossification mechanisms. Controlling Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a common molecular mechanism underlying chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and specification of intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

**summary:** 
* Objective \
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a population of cells broadly discussed to support cartilage repair. The differentiation of MSCs into articular chondrocytes is, however, still poorly understood on the molecular level. The aim of this study was to perform an almost genome-wide screen for genes differentially expressed between cartilage and MSCs and to extract new markers useful to define chondrocyte differentiation stages.

* Methods \
Gene expression profiles of MSCs (n = 8) and articular cartilage from OA patients (n = 7) were compared on a 30,000 cDNA-fragment array and differentially expressed genes were extracted by subtraction. Expression of selected genes was assessed during in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and during dedifferentiation of expanded chondrocytes using quantitative and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

* Results\
Eighty-seven genes were differentially expressed between MSCs and cartilage with a more than three-fold difference. Sixty-seven of them were higher expressed in cartilage and among them 15 genes were previously not detected in cartilage. Differential expression was confirmed for 69% of 26 reanalysed genes by RT-PCR. The profiles of three unknown transcripts and six protease-related molecules were characterised during differentiation. SERPINA1 and SERPINA3 mRNA expression correlated with chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, and SERPINA1 protein levels in culture supernatants could be correlated alike.

* Conclusions\
cDNA-array analysis identified SERPINA1 and A3 as new differentiation-relevant genes for cartilage. Since SERPINA1 secretion correlated with both chondrogenesis of MSCs and dedifferentiation during chondrocyte expansion, it represents an attractive marker for refinement of chondrocyte differentiation.

Highlights 
* We generated a mouse model of MSC aging through pNO40 targeted disruption.
* We identified a cryptic splicing product of mouse pNO40 in ko tissues.
* MSCs from ko mice develop accelerated aging and osteogenic differentiation defect.
* pNO40 disruption in MSCs elicits high levels of ROS and elevated expression of CYP1B1.\
**summary:**\
pNO40/PS1D, a novel nucleolar protein, has been characterized as a core protein of eukaryotic 60S ribosome and at least two splicing forms of pNO40 mRNAs with alternative starting sites have been identified. Through production of knockout (ko) mice with either exon 2 (△E2), exon 4 (△E4) or △E2+E4 targeted disruption we identified a cryptic splicing product occurring in the ko tissues examined which in general cannot be observed in regular RT-PCR detection of wild-type (wt) animals. Among ko animals, △E4 null embryos exhibited prominent senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, a marker for senescent cells, in notochord, forelimbs and heart while bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from △E4 null mice developed accelerated aging and osteogenic differentiation defects compared to those from wt and other isoform mutant mice. Examination of the causal relationship between pNO40 deficiency and MSC-accelerated aging revealed △E4 null disruption in MSCs elicits high levels of ROS and elevated expression levels of p16 and Rb but not p53. Further analysis with iTraq identified CYP1B1, a component of the cytochrome p450 system, as a potential molecule mediating ROS generation in pNO40 deficient MSCs. We herein established a mouse model of MSC aging through pNO40-targeted depletion and demonstrated the effects of loss of pNO40 on bone homeostasis.

**summary:**\
The purpose of this study was to evaluate gene expressions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) which contained ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone for 0 (control), 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days by 8.5k Genome Focus DNA microarray and real-time PCR. It was confirmed by the DNA microarray analysis that 327 genes of hMSC were significantly up-regulated by culture in OM especially at 14 and 21 days while 156 genes were down-regulated. Up-regulated genes included osteoblast-related genes such as secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin) gene and hypothetical protein expressed in osteoblast gene, along with angiogenesis-related genes and cell cycle arrestrelated genes, while down-regulated genes contained stroma-related genes and keratin-related genes. Expressions of several osteogenic differentiation marker genes such as (down-regulated) osteonectin gene and (up-regulated) BMP2 gene were also evaluated by real-time PCR. Gene expression database identified here might contribute to dental tissue engineering.

**summary:** \
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, which results in increased bone fragility and fracture risk. Casein kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) is a protein that plays an important role in regulation of bone formation. The effect of CKIP-1 on bone formation is mainly mediated through negative regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway. In addition, CKIP-1 has an important role in the progression of osteoporosis. This review provides a summary of the recent studies on the role of CKIP-1 in osteoporosis development and treatment.

**summary:** \
Casein kinase 2-interacting protein 1 (CKIP-1) is a negative regulator for bone formation. CKIP-1 knockout (KO) mice are very important for research on countermeasures to bone loss induced by space microgravity. Under simulated microgravity, the bone metabolism of CKIP-1 KO mice was different than that of wild-type (WT) mice. Many experiments all showed that the KO mice had significantly enhanced ossification in the tail suspension conditions, and the differences were closely related to the time the mice were exposed to the microgravity environment. Our results reveal the effect of CKIP-1 on the regulation of bone metabolism and osteogenesis in vivo and the ability of this gene to offset osteoporosis, and they suggest an approach to the treatment of osteoporosis induced by microgravity in space.

IF:1.922\

**summary:**\
Mechanical stimulation plays an important role in maintaining the growth and normal function of the skeletal system. Mechanical unloading occurs, for example, in astronauts spending long periods of time in space or in patients on prolonged bed rest, and causes a rapid loss of bone mass. Casein kinase 2‑interacting protein‑1 (CKIP‑1) is a novel negative bone regulation factor that has been demonstrated to reduce bone loss and enhance bone formation. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of constrained dynamic loading (Loading) in combination with CKIP‑1 gene knockout (KO) on unloading‑induced bone loss in tail‑suspension mice. The blood serum metabolism index [alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OCN) levels], tibia mechanical behavior (including bone trabecular microstructure parameters and tibia biomechanical properties), osteoblast‑related gene expression [ALP, OCN, collagen I and bone morphogenetic protein‑2 and osteoprotegerin (OPG)] and osteoclast‑related gene expression [receptor activators of NF‑kB ligand (RANKL)] were measured. The results demonstrated that mice experienced a loss of bone mass after four weeks of tail suspension compared with a wild type group. The mechanical properties, microarchitecture and mRNA expression were significantly increased in mice after Loading + KO treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, compared with loading or KO alone, the ratio of OPG/RANKL was increased in the combined treatment group. The combined effect of Loading + KO was greater than that observed with loading or KO alone (P<0.05). The present study demonstrates that Loading + KO can counter unloading‑induced bone loss, and combining the two treatments has an additive effect. These results indicate that combined therapy could be a novel strategy for the clinical treatment of disuse osteoporosis associated with space travel or bed rest.

**summary:** \
Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) present in the bone marrow are the precursors of osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, and hold tremendous potential for osteoregenerative therapy. However, achieving directed differentiation into osteoblasts has been a major concern. The use of lithium for enhancing osteogenic differentiation has been documented in animal models but its effect in humans is not clear. We, therefore, performed high throughput transcriptome analysis of lithium-treated hMSCs to identify altered gene expression and its relevance to osteogenic differentiation. Our results show suppression of proliferation and enhancement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity upon lithium treatment of hMSCs under non-osteogenic conditions. Microarray profiling of lithium-stimulated hMSC revealed decreased expression of adipogenic genes (CEBPA, CMKLR1, HSD11B1) and genes involved in lipid biosynthesis. Interestingly, osteoclastogenic factors and immune responsive genes (IL7, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL12, CCL20) were also downregulated. Negative transcriptional regulators of the osteogenic program (TWIST1 and PBX1) were suppressed while genes involved in mineralization like CLEC3B and ATF4 were induced. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of upregulated genes related to mesenchymal cell differentiation and signal transduction. Lithium priming led to enhanced collagen 1 synthesis and osteogenic induction of lithium pretreated MSCs resulted in enhanced expression of Runx2, ALP and bone sialoprotein. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RRAD, CLEC3B and ATF4 attenuated lithium-induced osteogenic priming, identifying a role for RRAD, a member of small GTP binding protein family, in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, our data highlight the transcriptome reprogramming potential of lithium resulting in higher propensity of lithium “primed” MSCs for osteoblastic differentiation.

**summary:**\
Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a systemic impairment of bone mass and microarchitecture that results in fragility fractures. With an ageing population, the medical and socioeconomic effect of osteoporosis, particularly postmenopausal osteoporosis, will increase further. A detailed knowledge of bone biology with molecular insights into the communication between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts and the orchestrating signalling network has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Novel treatment strategies have been developed that aim to inhibit excessive bone resorption and increase bone formation. The most promising novel treatments include: denosumab, a monoclonal antibody for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, a key osteoclast cytokine; odanacatib, a specific inhibitor of the osteoclast protease cathepsin K; and antibodies against the proteins sclerostin and dickkopf-1, two endogenous inhibitors of bone formation. This overview discusses these novel therapies and explains their underlying physiology.

**summary:** \
Osteoporosis is a systemic disease characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, resulting in an increased risk of fracture. While the level of bone mass can be estimated by measuring bone mineral density (BMD) using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), its measurement does not capture all the risk factors for fracture. Quantitative changes in skeletal turnover can be assessed easily and non-invasively by the measurement of serum and urinary biochemical markers; the most sensitive markers include serum osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, the N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen for bone formation, and the crosslinked C- (CTX) and N- (NTX) telopeptides of type I collagen for bone resorption. Advances in our knowledge of bone matrix biochemistry, most notably of post-translational modifications in type I collagen, are likely to lead to the development of new biochemical markers that reflect changes in the material property of bone, an important determinant of bone strength. Among those, the measurement of the urinary ratio of native (α) to isomerized (β) CTX — an index of bone matrix maturation — has been shown to be predictive of fracture risk independently of BMD and bone turnover.\
In postmenopausal osteoporosis, levels of bone resorption markers above the upper limit of the premenopausal range are associated with an increased risk of hip, vertebral, and nonvertebral fracture, independent of BMD. Therefore, the combined use of BMD measurement and biochemical markers is helpful in risk assessment, especially in those women who are not identified as at risk by BMD measurement alone. Levels of bone markers decrease rapidly with antiresorptive therapies, and the levels reached after 3–6 months of therapy have been shown to be more strongly associated with fracture outcome than changes in BMD. Preliminary studies indicate that monitoring changes of bone formation markers could also be useful to monitor anabolic therapies, including intermittent parathyroid hormone administration and, possibly, to improve adherence to treatment. Thus, repeated measurements of bone markers during therapy may help improve the management of osteoporosis in patients.
