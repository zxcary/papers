**summary:** \
Inactivation of β-catenin in mesenchymal progenitors prevents osteoblast differentiation; inactivation of Lrp5, a gene encoding a likely Wnt coreceptor, results in low bone mass (osteopenia) by decreasing bone formation. These observations indicate that Wnt signaling controls osteoblast differentiation and suggest that it may regulate bone formation in differentiated osteoblasts. Here, we study later events and find that stabilization of β-catenin in differentiated osteoblasts results in high bone mass, while its deletion from differentiated osteoblasts leads to osteopenia. Surprisingly, histological analysis showed that these mutations primarily affect bone resorption rather than bone formation. Cellular and molecular studies showed that β-catenin together with TCF proteins regulates osteoblast expression of Osteoprotegerin, a major inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation. These findings demonstrate that β-catenin, and presumably Wnt signaling, promote the ability of differentiated osteoblasts to inhibit osteoclast differentiation; thus, they broaden our knowledge of the functions Wnt proteins have at various stages of skeletogenesis.

**summary:** \ 
Chondrocytes and osteoblasts are two primary cell types in the skeletal system that are differentiated from common mesenchymal progenitors. It is believed that osteoblast differentiation is controlled by distinct mechanisms in intramembranous and endochondral ossification. We have found that ectopic canonical Wnt signaling leads to enhanced ossification and suppression of chondrocyte formation. Conversely, genetic inactivation of β-catenin, an essential component transducing the canonical Wnt signaling, causes ectopic formation of chondrocytes at the expense of osteoblast differentiation during both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Moreover, inactivation of β-catenin in mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro causes chondrocyte differentiation under conditions allowing only osteoblasts to form. Our results demonstrate that β-catenin is essential in determining whether mesenchymal progenitors will become osteoblasts or chondrocytes regardless of regional locations or ossification mechanisms. Controlling Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a common molecular mechanism underlying chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation and specification of intramembranous and endochondral ossification.

## CRIP1 + Mesenchymal

**summary:** 
* Objective \
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a population of cells broadly discussed to support cartilage repair. The differentiation of MSCs into articular chondrocytes is, however, still poorly understood on the molecular level. The aim of this study was to perform an almost genome-wide screen for genes differentially expressed between cartilage and MSCs and to extract new markers useful to define chondrocyte differentiation stages.

* Methods \
Gene expression profiles of MSCs (n = 8) and articular cartilage from OA patients (n = 7) were compared on a 30,000 cDNA-fragment array and differentially expressed genes were extracted by subtraction. Expression of selected genes was assessed during in vitro chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and during dedifferentiation of expanded chondrocytes using quantitative and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

* Results\
Eighty-seven genes were differentially expressed between MSCs and cartilage with a more than three-fold difference. Sixty-seven of them were higher expressed in cartilage and among them 15 genes were previously not detected in cartilage. Differential expression was confirmed for 69% of 26 reanalysed genes by RT-PCR. The profiles of three unknown transcripts and six protease-related molecules were characterised during differentiation. SERPINA1 and SERPINA3 mRNA expression correlated with chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, and SERPINA1 protein levels in culture supernatants could be correlated alike.

* Conclusions\
cDNA-array analysis identified SERPINA1 and A3 as new differentiation-relevant genes for cartilage. Since SERPINA1 secretion correlated with both chondrogenesis of MSCs and dedifferentiation during chondrocyte expansion, it represents an attractive marker for refinement of chondrocyte differentiation.

Highlights 
* We generated a mouse model of MSC aging through pNO40 targeted disruption.
* We identified a cryptic splicing product of mouse pNO40 in ko tissues.
* MSCs from ko mice develop accelerated aging and osteogenic differentiation defect.
* pNO40 disruption in MSCs elicits high levels of ROS and elevated expression of CYP1B1.\
**summary:**\
pNO40/PS1D, a novel nucleolar protein, has been characterized as a core protein of eukaryotic 60S ribosome and at least two splicing forms of pNO40 mRNAs with alternative starting sites have been identified. Through production of knockout (ko) mice with either exon 2 (△E2), exon 4 (△E4) or △E2+E4 targeted disruption we identified a cryptic splicing product occurring in the ko tissues examined which in general cannot be observed in regular RT-PCR detection of wild-type (wt) animals. Among ko animals, △E4 null embryos exhibited prominent senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, a marker for senescent cells, in notochord, forelimbs and heart while bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from △E4 null mice developed accelerated aging and osteogenic differentiation defects compared to those from wt and other isoform mutant mice. Examination of the causal relationship between pNO40 deficiency and MSC-accelerated aging revealed △E4 null disruption in MSCs elicits high levels of ROS and elevated expression levels of p16 and Rb but not p53. Further analysis with iTraq identified CYP1B1, a component of the cytochrome p450 system, as a potential molecule mediating ROS generation in pNO40 deficient MSCs. We herein established a mouse model of MSC aging through pNO40-targeted depletion and demonstrated the effects of loss of pNO40 on bone homeostasis.

**summary:**\
The purpose of this study was to evaluate gene expressions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium (OM) which contained ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate and dexamethasone for 0 (control), 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days by 8.5k Genome Focus DNA microarray and real-time PCR. It was confirmed by the DNA microarray analysis that 327 genes of hMSC were significantly up-regulated by culture in OM especially at 14 and 21 days while 156 genes were down-regulated. Up-regulated genes included osteoblast-related genes such as secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin) gene and hypothetical protein expressed in osteoblast gene, along with angiogenesis-related genes and cell cycle arrestrelated genes, while down-regulated genes contained stroma-related genes and keratin-related genes. Expressions of several osteogenic differentiation marker genes such as (down-regulated) osteonectin gene and (up-regulated) BMP2 gene were also evaluated by real-time PCR. Gene expression database identified here might contribute to dental tissue engineering.

**summary:** \
Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, which results in increased bone fragility and fracture risk. Casein kinase 2-interacting protein-1 (CKIP-1) is a protein that plays an important role in regulation of bone formation. The effect of CKIP-1 on bone formation is mainly mediated through negative regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway. In addition, CKIP-1 has an important role in the progression of osteoporosis. This review provides a summary of the recent studies on the role of CKIP-1 in osteoporosis development and treatment.

**summary:** \
Casein kinase 2-interacting protein 1 (CKIP-1) is a negative regulator for bone formation. CKIP-1 knockout (KO) mice are very important for research on countermeasures to bone loss induced by space microgravity. Under simulated microgravity, the bone metabolism of CKIP-1 KO mice was different than that of wild-type (WT) mice. Many experiments all showed that the KO mice had significantly enhanced ossification in the tail suspension conditions, and the differences were closely related to the time the mice were exposed to the microgravity environment. Our results reveal the effect of CKIP-1 on the regulation of bone metabolism and osteogenesis in vivo and the ability of this gene to offset osteoporosis, and they suggest an approach to the treatment of osteoporosis induced by microgravity in space.
